PlanRight - An African Online Digital Planner Store

Executive Summary:
PlanRight is a unique online store that aims to cater to the growing demand for digital planning solutions. Given the advancements in technology, it’s no wonder the custom made digital planner templates have become a hit and what better way to check off your to-do lists than by creating a list using ready made templates.  Our platform will exclusively offer a diverse range of stylish and functional digital planners, targeting individuals seeking efficient and eco-friendly alternatives to traditional paper planners. This article has been divided into two sections, the proposal and the process of building the application respectively.

Team
Joy Mbesa - Frontend Developer:
Responsibilities: Joy will focus on designing and implementing the user interface (UI) of the digital planner app. This includes creating visually appealing and user-friendly layouts, ensuring a seamless user experience, and incorporating responsive design principles. She will also work on client-side scripting, such as JavaScript, to enhance the interactivity of the app.
June Mbatha - Frontend Developer:
Responsibilities: I will collaborate with Joy on frontend development tasks. Her main focus will be on coding and implementing the frontend components, ensuring the proper functioning of user interfaces, and handling any frontend-related technical challenges. I will work closely with Joy to bring the design concepts to life and make the app aesthetically pleasing and functional.

Given that the digital planner app is a frontend-focused project, allocating both team members to frontend development aligns with the project's primary objectives. This division of roles ensures that the frontend aspect receives dedicated attention and expertise.

Backend
Backend responsibilities can be distributed evenly between the both of us. Responsibilities might include basic database setup, handling user authentication, and managing API endpoints. This approach allows us both to dip into backend development while still primarily focusing on the frontend.

Technologies
Languages:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript: Fundamental languages for building the frontend of the digital planner app. HTML for structuring the content, CSS for styling and handling the aesthetics of the site, and JavaScript to make it more interactive for the consumers who visit the site.
	
Backend Development (Python):
Web Framework (Flask): Flask is a lightweight web framework for Python that is well-suited for building web applications, including an online store such as PlanRight. 
Database (MySQL):
Database Design: MySQL through database and table creation will create and store product information, user details and orders made by the users.
Integration (Frontend + Backend):
APIs: The purpose of using APIs in the project will be so that we can use the APIs on the server to fetch and update data as well as reduce the redundancy of code.. The  project will also use JavaScript to make asynchronous requests (AJAX) from the frontend to these APIs.
Security:

The project intends on using HTTPS: Implement to secure data transmission between the user's browser and your server in order to facilitate security on both the user’s end and the company’s end.
Deployment:
Deployment of the PlanRight application Application upon completion of all the previously mentioned steps.
